# OVERVIEW
This is our senior project codenamed Project Playbook.  
The platform is built using React (Vite) for the frontend and Firebase for authentication, hosting, and configuration management.  
Future versions of the project plan to integrate Amazon S3 for secure video and media storage.  
Check the team contract file for more details.

# FEATURES
- Secure user authentication with Firebase (Email/Password and Google)
- Responsive React-based interface
- Role-based routing and protected pages
- AWS S3 media hosting (planned)
- Interactive dashboards and analytics (planned)

# TECH STACK

Frontend: React, React Router DOM, Vite  
Backend: Firebase Hosting and Cloud Functions (planned)  
Authentication: Firebase Authentication  
Database: Cloud Firestore (planned)  
File Storage: Amazon S3 (planned)  
Hosting: Firebase Hosting

# GETTING STARTED 

Must install node.js

# Local Development

Clone repo — purpose: get code locally
Command:

  git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-playbook.git

  cd project-playbook/app

Install dependencies — purpose: install packages for the app
Command:

  npm install

# Start dev server — purpose: run app at http://localhost:5173
Command:

  npm run dev


# GitHub Workflow

Stage changes — purpose: prepare files for commit
Command:

  git add .

Commit changes — purpose: record a snapshot with a message
Command:

  git commit -m "Describe the change"

Push to remote — purpose: publish code to GitHub
Command:

  git push origin main

NOTE:  Pushing to GitHub does NOT deploy to production. Meaning the firebase site is not updated.


# Deployment (Firebase Hosting)

Firebase Hosting is configured to deploy directly from the build directory:

  - Public directory: app/dist  
  - Entry point: index.html  
  - Custom route: /login.html  

Live site: https://projectplaybookauth-3c020.web.app
Project ID: projectplaybookauth-3c020

Owner: Mark Nudalo

Access: Contact Mark to be added in Firebase Console (Project Settings → Users and permissions → Add member).
Required role to deploy: Firebase Hosting Admin (or Editor).

Login (one-time per machine) — purpose: authenticate Firebase CLI
Command:

  firebase login

Build React app — purpose: generate production files to /app/dist
Command:
  
  cd app && npm run build && cd ..

Deploy to Hosting — purpose: upload /app/dist to the live site
Command:

firebase deploy

(Optional) Preview built app — purpose: test prod build locally
Command:

cd app && npm run preview

# STATUS

Active Development
AWS S3 integration, Firestore data handling, and role-based dashboards are planned for future updates.

│  ├─ public/    # static assets (login.html, favicon, images)
│  ├─ src/       # React components/pages/routes
│  └─ dist/      # Vite build output (generated)
├─ functions/    # Firebase Functions (optional)

# Notes

  - Do not modify node_modules — it’s automatically generated by npm.  
  - The /app/dist folder is generated after building with Vite.  
  - Place static assets (like images, icons, and favicon) in /app/public.  
  - The /functions directory is only used if backend Firebase logic (auth triggers, cloud calls) is needed.  
  - Amazon S3 will later be used for hosting video or large media files.

# FUTURE WORK

  - Implement Firestore for persistent user data and activity logs.  
  - Add AWS S3 integration for secure video uploads and storage.  
  - Include Firebase Cloud Functions for server-side automation.  
  - Develop a real-time dashboard and role-based access control (Admin, Instructor, Student).  
  - Add analytics and audit features for engagement tracking.
